# python-challenge
Obtained some guidance and help from my TA, peers, Data visualization tutor and AskBCS. 
Tried looking up resources through google and youtube.
Unfortunately, with much aid I was not able to complete my code.
The challenge was difficult, thus in my plain text there are the results I was able to find and my logic pasted and code.
